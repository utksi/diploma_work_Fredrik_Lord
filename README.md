# Optoelectronic Properties of Rare-Earth Based Halide Double Perovskites
## - a High Throughput Study

### Abstract

This study explores the possible improvement of the optoelectronic properties of halide double perovskites $A_2BB'X_6$, with $A \in$ \{+1 species\} such as Cs or Rb, $X \in$ \{-1 species\} such as Cl, Br or I, and B, B' chosen such that $\mathrm{B + B' =}$ +4. The aim of this study is to find compounds that can be mixed with a rare-earth element to potentially increase the optoelectronic properties. To this end, candidate materials were gathered from the Materials Project databases and previous high-throughput studies, sorted for both structural and thermodynamic stability, and their electronic structures were calculated at the level Density Functional Theory (DFT) using MetaGGA functionals, which offer a significant improvement towards the description of electronic structure of materials compared to typically used semi-local functionals.

%A number of potential mixes were found, all with $A$ as $Cs$ and most with $X$ as $Cl$. It was found that rare earths generally exhibited larger bandgaps, whereas elements in the $3d$-row in the periodic table exhibit smaller ones. 

Several promising combinations were identified, predominantly with A = Cs and X = Cl. It was observed that rare-earth elements generally resulted in larger bandgaps, while elements from the 3d row of the periodic table exhibited smaller bandgaps.
